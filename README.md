# Halo-Travel-Brochure-Page
Project 1 for CIS-435 Web Technology- Create a travel brochure page in responsive HTML and CSS for a fictional place.

In this project, you will create a responsive and visually appealing travel brochure for a
fictional destination using HTML, CSS, and Web media elements. This brochure will
showcase your skills in semantic HTML, CSS styling, and layout techniques such as CSS Grid
and Flexbox. No JavaScript is required for this project.
Your brochure should include consistent styling with CSS variables, a responsive layout,
and should demonstrate creative and appropriate use of HTML elements like forms, tables,
and images.
